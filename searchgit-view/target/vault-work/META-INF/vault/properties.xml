<entry key="description">All of the CQ component and template definitions for the 'Search Git' project.

        During development, the files in this module should be sync'd to your CQ instance using the FileVault command
        line tool available with CQ. There is also a plugin for Eclipse called "vaultclipse" that can be used instead
        of the command line tool.

        It is recommended that this module not contain any Java code and instead Java code should be placed in either
        the searchgit-taglib module or the searchgit-services module as appropriate.</entry>
